  abstract = {The goal of checkpoint is to solve the problem of package reproducibility in R. Specifically, checkpoint allows you to install packages as they existed on CRAN on a specific snapshot date as if you had a CRAN time machine. To achieve reproducibility, the checkpoint() function installs the packages required or called by your project and scripts to a local library exactly as they existed at the specified point in time. Only those packages are available to your project, thereby avoiding any package updates that came later and may have altered your results. In this way, anyone using checkpoint's checkpoint() can ensure the reproducibility of your scripts or projects at any time. To create the snapshot archives, once a day (at midnight UTC) Microsoft refreshes the Austria CRAN mirror on the "Microsoft R Archived Network" server ({$<$}https://mran.microsoft.com/{$>$}). Immediately after completion of the rsync mirror process, the process takes a snapshot, thus creating the archive. Snapshot archives exist starting from 2014-09-17.},

In 2016, a poll conducted by the journalNature reported that more than half (52\%) of scientistssurveyed believed science was facing a “replicationcrisis” (Baker 2016). More recently, some authors have moved tomore positive terms for describing this episode in science; forexample, Vazire (2018) refers instead to a “credibilityrevolution” highlighting the improved methods and open sciencepractices it has motivated., The crisis often refers collectively to at least the following things:, The associated open science reform movement aims to rectify conditionsthat led to the crisis. This is done by promoting activities such asdata sharing and public pre-registration of studies, and by advocatingstricter editorial policies around statistical reporting includingpublishing replication studies and statistically non-significantresults., This review consists of four distinct parts. First, we look at theterm “reproducibility” and related terms like“repeatability” and “replication”, presentingsome definitions and conceptual discussion about the epistemicfunction of different types of replication studies. Second, wedescribe the meta-science research that has established andcharacterised the reproducibility crisis, including large scalereplication projects and surveys of questionable research practices invarious scientific communities. Third, we look at attempts to addressepistemological questions about the limitations of replication, andwhat value it holds for scientific inquiry and the accumulation ofknowledge. The fourth and final part describes some of the manyinitiatives the open science reform movement has proposed (and in manycases implemented) to improve reproducibility in science. In addition,we reflect there on the values and norms which those reforms embody,noting their relevance to the debate about the role of values in thephilosophy of science.}

  abstract = {Viewing it as a chemical machine, is a larger body able to supply a greater amount of energy? A diagram may make this problem clearer. As is indicated in the accompanying figure (Fig. I), the body is divided into two cavities, a dorsal and a ventral. The dorsal, housing the brain and spinal cord, need not now engage our attention. But the ventral, it is seen, is divided by a muscular partition, the diaphragm, into two sections: the thoracic, in which lie the heart and lungs; and the abdominal, occupied in the main by the digestive system. The action of these various organs, briefly stated, is as follows: the food is taken into the mouth, there masticated, mixed with saliva, and swallowed. In the stomach and intestines this food is mixed with other fluids, digested, and after being absorbed through the stomach and intestinal walls, is carried away by the circulation. In the cells of the body this nutritive material combined with oxygen develops energy. The waste products of the process are removed by the blood which, in turn, is purified in the lungs. Now the question arises, a similar effectiveness of action being granted in each case: will not more capacious organs mean increased power? Or, stating it in terms of the preceding chapter: should not leaders be physically large? Viewing it as a chemical machine, is a larger body able to supply a greater amount of energy? It was with a view to bringing statistical evidence to bear upon this question, among others, that a letter of inquiry was sent to one hundred leading railroad executives, presidents in most cases, but a number of general managers of the larger systems being also included; fifty-five replied. Tabulated, their answers reveal the interesting information that this group of men average five feet, ten and nine tenths inches in height; weight one hundred eighty-six pounds. This chapter discusses the physique of executives. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Exploiting genetic variations to create instrumental variables for observed height, we find that while OLS regressions yield that an additional centimeter in height is associated with a 10–13\% increase in one’s annual earnings, IV estimates reveal only an insubstantial causal effect of height. Further analyses suggest that the observed height premium is likely to pick up the impacts of several cognitive/noncognitive skills on earnings confounded in previous studies, such as mental health, risk preference, and personality factors. Our study is the first empirical study that employs genetic IVs in developing countries, and our results contribute to the recent debate on the mechanism of height premium.}

  title = {Economic Recovery of {{EU}} Regions after 2008},
  abstract = {Following a peak in 2008, the value of gross domestic product (GDP) per inhabitant in purchasing power standard (PPS) of EU regions generally fell in 2009 because of the crisis. However, GDP per inhabitant has subsequently risen albeit at a varying pace across EU regions as regional economies have recovered. In approximately half of 280 EU NUTS level 2 regions, GDP per capita had returned to or rose above its 2008 level within two years. For further 111, GDP per inhabitant remained below its 2008 level for between three and eight years.   The source dataset is accessible here.   More generally, in most regions in the north, west and east of the EU, GDP per inhabitant had stayed above or returned above their 2008 level by 2013 at the latest; with the exceptions of: much of Finland and several regions in Sweden among the northern EU Member States; several regions in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom among the western Member States; all regions of Croatia and Slovenia, and a few regions of Czechia among the eastern Member States. The main concentration of regions whose GDP per inhabitant was still below its 2008 level by 2014 was in the southern EU Member States of Greece, Spain, Italy, Cyprus and Portugal; with the exceptions of: Malta (one region at this level of detail); four Italian regions \textemdash{} Valle d'Aosta/Vall\'ee d'Aoste, Abruzzo, Puglia and the Provincia Autonoma di Bolzano/Bozen; and three Portuguese regions \textemdash{} Norte, Centro and the Regi\~ao Aut\'onoma dos A\c{c}ores.   Bucking the trend It is worth noting that in 10 regions, GDP per inhabitant rose rather than fell in 2009.  Six of these regions were in Poland, two in France (Corsica, Guyane) and one each in Greece (Dytiki Makedonia) and Finland (\AA land). Most of these 10 regions experienced an uninterrupted increase in their GDP per inhabitant despite the crisis. This  was the case in Corsica (France) and the six Polish regions. The other three regions \textemdash{} Dytiki Makedonia (Greece), Guyane (France) and \AA land (Finland) \textemdash{} recorded a fall one year later. In other words, their GDP per inhabitant peaked in 2009 rather than in 2008.   Are you interested in further information on regional socioeconomic developments? You can find it in the dedicated chapter of the Eurostat regional yearbook 2019. This chapter uses key indicators from a variety of datasets to analyse socioeconomic developments within the EU from 2008 \textemdash{} when the global financial and economic crisis was first felt in the EU \textemdash{} through to the latest period available.
