  abstract = {The well-known association between height and earnings is often thought to reflect factors such as self esteem, social dominance, and discrimination. We offer a simpler explanation: height is positively associated with cognitive ability, which is rewarded in the labor market. Using data from the US and the UK, we show that taller children have higher average cognitive test scores, and that these test scores explain a large portion of the height premium in earnings. Children who have higher test scores also experience earlier adolescent growth spurts, so that height in adolescence serves as a marker of cognitive ability.},

  abstract = {Viewing it as a chemical machine, is a larger body able to supply a greater amount of energy? A diagram may make this problem clearer. As is indicated in the accompanying figure (Fig. I), the body is divided into two cavities, a dorsal and a ventral. The dorsal, housing the brain and spinal cord, need not now engage our attention. But the ventral, it is seen, is divided by a muscular partition, the diaphragm, into two sections: the thoracic, in which lie the heart and lungs; and the abdominal, occupied in the main by the digestive system. The action of these various organs, briefly stated, is as follows: the food is taken into the mouth, there masticated, mixed with saliva, and swallowed. In the stomach and intestines this food is mixed with other fluids, digested, and after being absorbed through the stomach and intestinal walls, is carried away by the circulation. In the cells of the body this nutritive material combined with oxygen develops energy. The waste products of the process are removed by the blood which, in turn, is purified in the lungs. Now the question arises, a similar effectiveness of action being granted in each case: will not more capacious organs mean increased power? Or, stating it in terms of the preceding chapter: should not leaders be physically large? Viewing it as a chemical machine, is a larger body able to supply a greater amount of energy? It was with a view to bringing statistical evidence to bear upon this question, among others, that a letter of inquiry was sent to one hundred leading railroad executives, presidents in most cases, but a number of general managers of the larger systems being also included; fifty-five replied. Tabulated, their answers reveal the interesting information that this group of men average five feet, ten and nine tenths inches in height; weight one hundred eighty-six pounds. This chapter discusses the physique of executives. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {The relation between adult body height and two socio-economic factors (income and educational level) was studied in a large, ethnically homogenous population. In the period 1980-1983 all persons aged 40-54 years (born 1926-1941) in two Norwegian counties were invited to a cardiovascular screening. Ninety per cent (or 38 162 persons) of those invited attended and had their height measured. Information concerning income and education was available at an individual level from the 1980 national census. Strong, positive relations were found between mean body height and the socio-economic factors, relations that probably are due to conditions during growth influencing both height, attained education and income abilities. The difference between highest and lowest educational class was 3.3cm in men and 3.2cm in women, and between highest and lowest income group 3.5cm in men and 4.2cm in women. These differences could not be explained by the strong cohort effect of increasing height in the successive birth cohorts from 1926 to 1941 which also was evident. It should be emphasized that height only could explain a small fraction of the variance in the socio-economic factors and is thus not a usable indicator of an individual's socio-economic status. However, it might contribute with important information concerning social inequalities in groups or population.},

In the 17th century, scientists would communicate through letters and were able to understand and assimilate major developments across all the emerging major disciplines. In 2016—the most recent year for which data are available—more than 2,295,000 scientific and engineering research articles were published worldwide (National Science Foundation, 2018e). In addition, the number of scientific and engineering fields and subfields of research is large and has greatly expanded in recent years, especially in fields that intersect disciplines (e.g., biophysics); more than 230 distinct fields and subfields can now be identified. The published literature is so voluminous and specialized that some researchers look to information retrieval, machine learning, and artificial intelligence techniques to track and apprehend the important work in their own fields.},
